      <p>Butterflies are beautiful creations of nature that along with the moths, make up the insect order Lepidoptera. Butterflies are almost worldwide in their distribution and are highly sensitive indicators of the health of the environment and play vital roles in the food chain as well as being pollinators of plants.Butterflies are all around us, in almost every part of India except very high snow-clad mountains where the temperature is very low and below the freezing point where these tiny cold-blooded creatures cannot survive.We need butterflies because they are the bio-indicators and can sense the slightest alteration in an ecosystem. Their richness in an ecosystem is also influenced by many environmental factors like humidity, temperature and availability of larval host plants because butterflies lay eggs only on specific plants known as larval host plants. Butterflies can be seen everywhere, basking on rocks, on ground perched on a dead animal and sucking body fluids, on rotting fruits sipping alcoholic juices or mud puddling on a wet patch of soil and sipping minerals and salts.
        Butterflies draw our attention for countless reasons that of course include their beauty, unique life history, various adaptations in compliance with the habitat they live in, their migration, and many more such aspects. Butterflies are the creatures with two pairs of 'scaly' wings and three pairs of legs, abdomen, head with two compound eyes, and a thorax. They belong to a group of insects called 'Lepidoptera' that includes moths also with them. Lepidoptera is a Greek word that refers to 'lapis' meaning scales and 'pteron' meaning wings. These iridescent scales are arranged in a particular formation that can be compared with the tiles of a village hut and when they are touched, these scales stick to our fingers.

        India is one of the mega biodiversity countries where nearly 1500 species and subspecies are found of the 17,000 species worldwide, and interestingly nearly 20 per cent of them are endemic to this region, thus, making India a hotspot of butterfly diversity in the world. The largest one is the Southern Birdwing with a wingspan of 190 mm whereas the smallest one is the grass jewel with a wingspan of only 15 mm. There is another species called the Blue Pigmy butterfly, which is found in Southern California and is also amongst one of the smallest.

Butterflies have a long association with humans. If we look into ancient history, we would find the mention of butterflies in folklores, fairy tales, poetry, Mughal art, and so on, and probably that is the reason we still hear the word titli in many of our Hindi songs. Many fashion designers get inspired by their wing patterns and it is depicted in their respective works.

When we talk about the nomenclature of butterflies, we have to go back to the history of the British Era in India, in particular to their army as many of them were naturalists and had given names to Indian butterflies in the same way as the ranks in their army. To name a fewâ€”Commodore, Sailor, Sergeant, etc., and when those ranks got exhausted, they used Indian royal.

Names, such as raja, queen, nawab, emperor, and so on. They used the names of birds, animals, plants, trees, etc. Where they could not find anything matching with the butterfly, they named it something funny like 'Monkey Puzzle', a butterfly found in India. The world still follows the same nomenclature even today. Edward Donovan, an epitome of the natural history of insects in India and Indian seas, extensively worked on Indian insects. Today, butterflies have been broadly classified into two major categories, that is, Papilionidae also called true butterflies, and Hesperiidae that includes the skippers.
